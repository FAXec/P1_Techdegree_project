        <h2>Interests and Travel</h2>

        
          <p> I enjoy travelling and have travelled to many places in North America, South America, Asia and the Middle East.
          The places that I enjoyed the most are in South America and Asia because of I was able to spend time with locals and truely connect  with them.
          I always wanted to visit Brazil but never got a chance do to so.</p>
          <p>To fulfil my travel related passion, I joined Aviation industry and this gave me more oppertunity to travel and I started making travel related videos. In this way, I coud shre my experience with the world.
          <p>Apart from travelling, I love taking pictures of strangers and capture locals and their culture with my camera lens</p>
          <p>When I get time, I love working out. </p>
