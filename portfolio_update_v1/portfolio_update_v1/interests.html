        <h1>Interests and Travel</h1>
        <p>I enjoy travelling and have travelled to many places in North America, South America, Asia and the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The place that I enjoyed the most is South America and Asia because of I was able to spend time with locals and truely connect  with them.</p>
        <p> I always wanted to visit Brazil but never got a chance do to so.</p>
        <p>Apart from travelling, I love taking pictures of strangers and capture locals and their culture with my camera lens</p>
        <p>I fulfil my travel related passion, I joined Aviation industry and this gave me more oppertunity to travel and I started making travel related videos. In this way, I coud shre my experience with the world.</p>
          <p>When I get time, I love working out.</p>
